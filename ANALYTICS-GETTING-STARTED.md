## Background

❤️ By the community, for the community. ❤️

We are building an open source CoronaTracker app to help educate the public and reduce the community transmissions.

## Values

Social good through technology. We value initiative, collaboration and experimentation. We say what we mean, and do what we say.

We are a welcoming, warm and collaborative group of people from all over the world! Here you can experiment, take chances. Failure is ok. We are here to help. We encourage developers to learn new things and best practices while collaborating on a project that is scaling to help mankind against COVID-19.

## Townhalls

We also hold weekly townhalls Saturdays from 12:00pm EST to 12:30 EST. Join discord for more details.

The typical agenda is:  

1) Team leads will give an update of the project.
2) Discuss roadmap.
3) Discuss deadline.
4) Explain things that need to be done to hit current goal.
