# covid_on_social

The aim of covid_on_social is to gain insights into the discussion about COVID-19 on social media. The data we gather from social media can be used to train an NLP model for processing and interpreting free-text data our app collects (the section of the app where users can leave comments). See issue #9 for more information and to add ideas about how this feature should be implemented.

## Possible sources for scraping

- twitter (i.e. using the Twitter API search endpoint with keywords or hashtags)

- subreddits dedicated to coronavirus symptom discussion (if these actually exist)

- instagram/facebook groups for coronavirus discussion

- any other social media or chat platforms you can think of, please add them to the list!

In terms of developer accounts for using these platforms' APIs, not sure whether you wanted to apply for one separately for the CoronaTracker org? If so I can get that done
